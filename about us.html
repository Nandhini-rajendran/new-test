    <p>Driver's education, driver education, driving education, driver's ed,
         or driving tuition or driving lessons is a formal class or program
        that prepares a new driver to obtain a learner's permit or driver's license. 
        The formal class program may also prepare existing license holders for an overseas
         license conversion or medical assessment driving test or refresher course. 
         It may take place in a classroom, in a vehicle, online, or a combination of the above.
        Topics of instruction include traffic code or laws and vehicle operation. 
        Typically, instruction will warn of dangerous conditions in driving such as road conditions, 
        driver impairments, and hazardous weather. Instructional videos may also be shown, 
        demonstrating proper driving strategies and the consequences for not observing the rules.
        Education is intended to supplement the knowledge obtained from government-printed driving
     handbooks or manuals and prepares students for tests to obtain a driver's license or learner's permit. 
     In-car instruction places a student in a vehicle with an instructor. 
     A car fitted with dual controls, which has pedals or other controls on the passenger side, may be used.
     Driver's education (or driver education) is intended to supplement the knowledge obtained from government-printed 
     driving handbooks or manuals and prepares students for tests to obtain a driver's license or learner's permit. 
     In-car instruction places a student in a vehicle with an instructor. A car fitted with dual controls,
      which have pedals or other controls on the passenger side, may be used. In the United States,
       driver's education is typically offered to students who are sixteen years old or will be by the end of the course.
        Each state has its own laws regarding the licensing of teenagers.
         In Germany, space is at a premium while traffic is able to flow very efficiently and with fewer collisions.
          The way in which people are taught driving fundamentals plays a huge role in the safety and efficiency of traffic.
           Within the United States, students may have access to online training, classroom training, 
           or parent-taught courses. While these classes may provide a lot of information to the student, 
           their effectiveness may only be limited to one area of knowledge. In Germany, 
           students are given a hybrid of these classes. They have much more exposure throughout their school to real-world
            scenarios and classroom curriculum. Fundamentals of driving are reinforced in these classes,
             including the importance of turn-signal usage,
              keeping a safe distance behind others, and maintaining situational awareness.
               It is argued that more efficient and safer traffic flow can be achieved by increasing the length 
               of the driver's education classes in the United States, to involve more hands-on training and strengthening
                of driving principles.Some car clubs conduct driver education programs focused on how to handle a car under high-speed driving conditions rather than on learning the rules of the road. 
                These programs take place at road racing courses and include both classroom instruction and vehicle-based instruction.
                Students drive with an experienced instructor until they are "signed off". At this point they can continue practicing and improving their skills without an instructor. Driver education programs involve multiple cars together on a racetrack, but they are not considered racing because they are not timed, winners are not declared, and drivers must wait to pass until the driver being passed gives permission with a hand signal.[citation needed] These programs require approved racing helmets and rollover protection for convertibles. Some require long-sleeved shirts and long pants for fire safety. However, they do not require full roll cages, five or six-point seat belts, fire extinguishers, 
                fire-resistant racing suits, or other safety features seen in racing and more.
